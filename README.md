# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Keras

This [notebook](https://github.com/mrdbourke/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Keras/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Keras.ipynb) contains the code relating to Learning Intelligence 25.

It's a run through of a sentiment analysis model using Keras on the IMDB dataset.

You will build a Keras model from the ground up to classify IMDB movie reviews as being postive or negative. 

When deciding if a review is postive or negative, the model built in this notebook should achieve at least 85% accuracy. 

For more information on Keras check out the documentation at [keras.io](http://keras.io).

Happy learning!
